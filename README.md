# MO824B - Topics in Combinatorial Optimization  

This repository contains assignments and projects developed for the graduate course **MO824B - Topics in Combinatorial Optimization**, offered by the **Institute of Computing, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)**.  

## Course Description  
The course covers methodologies for solving problems in **combinatorial optimization** and **operations research**. Mathematical formulations and metaheuristics (multi-start, trajectory-based, and population-based) are studied. Performance evaluation techniques are applied to analyze solution methodologies. By the end of the course, students are expected to propose effective solution methodologies for combinatorial optimization problems in operations research.  

## Program  
1. Multi-start, trajectory-based, and population-based metaheuristics (GRASP, tabu search, and genetic algorithms).  
2. Performance analysis of algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.  
3. Selected research articles on combinatorial optimization methodologies applied to operations research problems.  
4. Development of an operations research project in combinatorial optimization.  

## Prerequisites  
1. Fundamental concepts of linear programming and integer programming: formulations, optimality, relaxations, and bounds.  
2. Algorithm design and data structures in high-level programming languages.
